(ns caneops.governor
  "Cane Operations Governor -- the independent compliance layer that earns
  the CaneOpsAdvisor the right to commit. The LLM has no notion of:
    - Whether the cane field a proposal targets is actually registered
    - Whether a proposal is a real actuation (`:effect :propose` only --
      this actor NEVER directly controls field equipment or executes
      anything)
    - Whether an op is inside this actor's closed coordination allowlist
    - Whether a logged field-record acreage or ratoon-cycle is a plausible
      observation
    - Whether a supply-order's cost exceeds the escalation threshold

  This MUST be a separate system able to *reject* a proposal and fall
  back to HOLD.

  This actor is a back-office OPERATIONS COORDINATOR only -- direct
  field-equipment operation and finalizing a pre-harvest-burn or
  pesticide-application decision are categorically outside its authority
  (grower/agronomist exclusive). The Governor enforces that boundary
  structurally, not by trusting the advisor's judgment.

  CRITICAL: Any proposal to flag a crop-health concern (borer infestation,
  disease, drought-stress) ALWAYS escalates to a human
  (grower/agronomist) for final sign-off. The LLM's confidence is never
  sufficient for crop-health decisions.

  Hard violations (always HOLD, no override, permanent):
    1. Cane field not registered (field-id missing or unknown to Store)
    2. Proposal `:effect` is not `:propose` (no direct execution, ever)
    3. Op is `:operate-field-equipment`, `:finalize-burn-decision`, or
       `:finalize-pesticide-application` -- direct field-equipment
       operation and finalizing a pre-harvest-burn or pesticide-
       application decision are PERMANENTLY blocked regardless of
       proposal content or confidence
    4. Op is outside the closed proposal-op allowlist
    5. `:log-field-record` with a non-positive acreage
    6. `:log-field-record` with a negative ratoon-cycle

  Soft gates (always escalate for human):
    - `:flag-crop-health-concern` -- ALWAYS escalates
    - `:order-supplies` above its category cost threshold
    - Low confidence

  This design mirrors `riceops.governor` (cloud-itonami-isic-0112) but
  specializes sugar-cane plantation back-office coordination concerns
  (cane-field registration, closed op allowlist, field-equipment and
  burn/pesticide-decision exclusion, ratoon-cycle validity, cost
  threshold) rather than paddy-rice water-management concerns."
